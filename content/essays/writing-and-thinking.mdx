excerpt: 'Exploring the relationship between writing and thinking in an AI-dominated world, and why preserving these skills matters more than ever.'

As a high school student in 2025, I have realized how scarce the skill of writing will become in the upcoming years.

I'm not saying this as if I were merely an outside observer, since I myself have become worse at being articulate after using AI on a daily basis—part of the reason why I started writing these essays. I'm definitely not advocating against using AI, since it would be stupid to think like that for a variety of reasons. All I'm doing is merely expressing that which I’ve become aware of in the past couple of months… There's a need for a balance here, at least if you don't want to give up your ability to write.

Writing is one of the best ways to develop thinking, and considering that we're using most AI models not just to write random stuff, but to think through complex tasks in a more "efficient" way via text, by extension it's not that we'll lose the skill of writing that worries me, but the ability to think.

Thinking is hard. I believe most of us don't like to think, and few of us actually do it regularly. In a world that's ever-changing, you can't stop and think about everything—you have to carefully choose what’s worth thinking about. As a solution to this, so as not to be left behind, we inform ourselves through others about what's happening out there. The printing press, radio, and television made information more accessible; therefore, we've become more informed as a whole—but that doesn't mean we've become better thinkers.

Most people don't bother with thinking—they just want to be told what to believe… The reason you might choose to read a book over a blog post on any given topic is the depth the author offers in his writing. By reading a book, you start to understand why the author thinks the way he does, which in turn makes it easier for you to create counterpoints and disapprove of the ideas presented. On the other hand, in a blog post, you don't have any of that depth—everything is surface level, just a set of ideas. You might agree or disagree with what's being said, but you can't go through the thought process of the blogger. More than anything, people don't even want to go as deep as reading an article—they'd rather just read the title. The issue is that we've optimized for information memorization rather than actual thinking.

Remember the school essays? That's the kind of writing that inhibits thinking; you’re supposed to know everything you're going to say before you start your introduction. There's a clear structure: argument A, argument B, a conclusion, etc. But that's not how thinking works. When you think, you don't know where you'll end up—that's why we think in the first place: to find new answers, to explore.

In order to be a clear thinker, you do need to possess a lot of information—but information alone is useless. You must understand how to connect the dots. Besides, the information I refer to is based on observations, rather than well-rounded, thoughtful ideas that are already fully formed and hard to decompose into basic components.

As I'm writing this, I realize that maybe most of us were just under the impression that we "think"... I mean, in the end, none of our thoughts are really original. We're like AI models that generalize based on all the data they receive... It's just that some of us use only RAG and forget the part of generating something...
